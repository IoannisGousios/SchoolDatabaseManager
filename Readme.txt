A very simple database manipulation program demonstrating the basic CRUD operations. It creates, reads, updates and deletes by using the most basic of methods and also has repetitive code but the main point was to practice and try to improve my skills in database manipulation and be as easy as possible for the begginers, like myself, :P to understand. If you try it out don't forget to use the correct JDBC driver and define the correct file path where your database file is located. I have included the database named school.db.
